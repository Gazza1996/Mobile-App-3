# TEMBAK
A 2D unity platformer created for a 4th Year Mobile Applications Project. 

## Overview
I have been given a game to develop in unity, the game is a 2D platformer like that of the first version Mario Bros.
I was given a design document which I must follow to create the game, but I will also be meeting with the customer to discuss possible modifications to the game.

## Controls
